This is by no means a complete project. By the time I'm ready for a true '1.0' release, it should be a completely flexible, performant project that can be easily adapted to other games.
In the meantime:

Maps
----
* It would be nice to store them in JSON so the Function constructor, which is basically eval in disguise, isn't used as a security risk. That gets tricky with the repeating Castle areas, but could probably be done by adding a 'repeat-offset' style variable.

Things
------
* At the moment it looks like a high school senior skipped the OOP day of class. Thing constructors should be stored in JSON, not as functions.
* Instead of having *.movementInit functions, turn the bland .onadding into a fancy .onAdding for this purpose, which would increase editor compatibility and make more sense for the game.

Editor
------
* Bring back the erasor!
* Give a way to set different areas in the map and ways to get around them
* Time as an option under settings

Sounds
------
* Short-term: get standardized, cleaned versions of the audio files (and why the heck doesn't Firefox play the themes?)
* Long-term: use https://github.com/meenie/band.js
